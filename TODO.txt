#0: Get escape key to behave.

Right now it doesn't register in getch until another key is pressed afterwards. This is problematic.

#1: Get F1, F2, F3, F4, F5 and numbap 5 keys to behave.

Right now they are sending multiple characters, we don't like that.

#2: Once our keyboard is behaving, it'd a matter of mapping keys to behavior.

Each window (main screen, spell selection, help menu etc) will have a list of behavior (exit the menu, move the player up, dance around in circles etc).
There will be a config file mapping numeric key ids to behavior.
Once we sucessfully get the key to behavior mapping layer complete, we can stop thinking about low level stuff such as key presses forever hopefully.
