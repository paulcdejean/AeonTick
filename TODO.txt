#2: Sketch out the event loop.

#3: Once our keyboard is behaving, it'd a matter of mapping keys to behavior.

Each window (main screen, spell selection, help menu etc) will have a list of behavior (exit the menu, move the player up, dance around in circles etc).
There will be a config file mapping numeric key ids to behavior.
Once we sucessfully get the key to behavior mapping layer complete, we can stop thinking about low level stuff such as key presses forever hopefully.
